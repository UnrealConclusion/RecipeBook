A recipe book application that allows the user to add recipes to a database and search for them by ingredients.

## Architecture and Technologies

The server connects to and interacts with the database using Mongoose, an object data modeling library for MongoDB. An api is made available to the front-end using Express.js. The front-end of the application is built with React-js.
